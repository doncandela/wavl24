"""Module wavl.py in the wavl24 package has some classes and functions to
carry out some elementary wavelet operations.

See: Numerical Recipes Third Ed. by Press et al. (2007), referred to below
as NR3, esp. Sec. 13.10 from which some code in this module was adapted. Note
pywavelets (not used here) is a much more complete and advanced wavele
package than this module.
